# bos-workspace

üï∞Ô∏è **Legacy `bos-workspace` users can use the [migration guide](https://github.com/NEARBuilders/bos-workspace/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) to upgrade or read the legacy documentation for v0.0.1-alpha.6 [here](https://github.com/NEARBuilders/bos-workspace/tree/version/0.0.1-alpha.6).**

üß∞ `bos-workspace` is a comprehensive toolset designed to simplify the development and deployment of [NEAR components](https://docs.near.org/bos/tutorial/quickstart) and applications. With support for hot reload, TypeScript, and multiple app management, it caters to developers looking for an efficient and scalable development environment.

## Quickstart üèÉüèæ

### Installation üèóÔ∏è

You can install `bos-workspace` globally on your machine or within your existing project workspace using npm (or other package manager):

global install:

```js
npm -g install bos-workspace
```

or navigate to your project directory and install:

```js
npm install bos-workspace
```

To verify `bos-workspace` in installed, you can check for a current version:

```js
bos - workspace - V;
```

To start, you may clone an existing project by navigating to your project directory and running the `clone` command:

```js
bos-workspace clone [accountId]
```

where `accountId ` is your named NEAR account (yourname.near)

In the terminal, navigate to the account name workspace, then run `bos-workspace-dev` to start the development server.

The image below is an example of what your terminal and browser should look like once you've opened the local gateway.

### Usage üë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You can use your `bos-workspace` for both single and multi app development by taking advantage of the relationship between `Apps` and `Workspaces`

**App:** üõ†Ô∏è

- belongs to an Account
- described by a `bos.config.json` where the content is:

```js
{
    "account": "app.near"
}
```

- path to code: `{projectId}/widget/*`
- cloning: `bos-workspace clone {accountId}` to create an App with `bos.config.json` set up and pull in all of the widgets from that `accountId`

<br><br>

**Workspace:** üõ†Ô∏è

- able to hold multiple Apps at the same time (similar to a monrepo)
- described by a `bos.workspace.json` where the content is:

```js
{
    "apps": ["/apps/*"]
}
```

üìù **Note:** App names are not required to end in `.near` or be stored in a directory named `/apps`. Be sure your `bos.config.json` is located at the same level as directories like `/widget` and your `bos.workspace.json` reflects the name of the directory where your apps are located
